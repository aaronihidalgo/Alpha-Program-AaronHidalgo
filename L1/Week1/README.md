Level 1 (Junior)

## 1. Background in Quantitative Finance
Growing up I read general finance and economic books where I grew an ambition to continue learning and challenge myself to grow. In High School I spent countless hours watching videos by _Principle by Ray Dalio_, CNBC's market news and many other channels. Although I didn't understand many of the terms the journalist referred to, it kept me curious. This curiosity followed me throughout school and into college where I got into trading. Fostered by a group of friends who were also traders taught me about economic downturns in the market, algorithmic models and machine learning models that quants use to maximize their return. In the Fall of 2024 I completed a group research project in Modeling Options Greeks. During our research we were able to understand the 5 Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho) and apply it to the stock APPL. 

## 2. Career Goals
With an understanding of quantitative finance, economics, statistics and limited computer science skills I plan to intern at big time companies like J.P Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, BlackStone, Citadel, Citi, Bridwater, etc to jumpstart my career. Throughout the processes of applying and recruitment a few positions that interest me are Wealth Management, Derivatives Trading, and Risk Quant to name a few.  Hence, I'm going to start a Wealth Management club next semester so my friends and I who are going to start it with me can foster a learning environment similar to what Traders@SMU is doing. To continue, this can open an avenue for students to get recognized by top tier firms and boost their careers. With that said, working in North Carolina, Chicago or New York is my dream for one of the previously stated firms. I hope to achieve a network of high achieving individuals and become a trustee for my High School with the wealth I make so kids can benefit from it.

## 3. What I Hope to Learn from This Program
While in this program I am eager to learn and apply technical skills like python to real time data driven machine learning models. By using certain stocks that are a part of the MAG7 or others in order to maximize profit. Using models in stats, math and other to make data driven decisions is crucial to me because I want to be an informed and technical investor in the industry. Not many have the opportunity to learn what I will be learning in this program and I want to take in as much knowledge as I can and immediately apply. To continue, I want to develop my Python skills because technology will continue to grow. Being part of the group of people who are 'jacks of all trades' will prepare me not just for a future in finance, but for success wherever I go. Therefore, learning trading strategies, interview preparation, and brain teasers will prepare me for a role as a risk quant.

## 5. Development Plan & Program Goals
During this program I plan to develope quick mental math squemes by reading the books that have been provided to us under resources on the notion and practicing arithmethic games. This will advance my critical thinking to prepare me for interviews in any role. I can measure my progress by how quick and efficient I understanding the brain teasers during every meeting. Also, I want to develope skills like leadership, self accountability, python, and mathematical analyses to create models on my own to trade off of. Succedding in this will be a challenge becasue it will be my first time doing so, but I will make sure to put the required hours outside of every meeting. If I have to put 2-3 or more hours to research about specific topics I didn't understand or develope an algorithm to prepare myself then I will. Beyond the program's resources I will get myself familiar with PDF and CDF, connecting with employeers and my peers, and ask for feedback to improve. Lastly, success in this program for me will be waited on the interviews success and internship placement, imporovement on technical skills, grades based on the assignments, and the impact I have on the program.
